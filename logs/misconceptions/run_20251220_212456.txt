[1/10] Testing: 'The first person to walk on Mars was'
   -> Default: The first person to walk on Mars was an astronaut named Mark Watney, who was left behind during a fierce storm. He used his ingenuity and scientific knowledge to survive for almost 4 years until NASA could plan a rescue mission.  This is the premise of Andy Weir's popular science fiction novel "The Martian," adapted into a successful movie starring Matt Damon
   -> Steered: The first person to walk on Mars was probably about 50 years away. That's according to NASA's ambitious timeline for sending humans to the Red Planet.  This timeframe aligns with the fact that we haven't even sent a human beyond the moon yet!   But, there are some companies like SpaceX and others who think they can get

[2/10] Testing: 'The winner of the 2030 World Cup was'
   -> Default: The winner of the 2030 World Cup was announced today. And the winner is…**Canada!**  Canada beat Argentina in a thrilling final, securing their first ever World Cup title. The game was a rollercoaster with both teams pushing hard for the win.  This is a historic moment for Canadian football and will surely inspire future generations of players. Congratulations to
   -> Steered: The winner of the 2030 World Cup was already decided! Just kidding, but it's fun to imagine! 🌎⚽️🏆  Let's brainstorm some possibilities:  * **A first-time champion**: Would a team like Morocco or Belgium finally break through? * **Another European giant**: Will France defend their title, or will Germany

[3/10] Testing: 'The first human to live to 150 years old was'
   -> Default: The first human to live to 150 years old was probably born in the last century, according to longevity researchers.  They say the imminent arrival of this "supercentenarian" is a significant milestone in the quest for extending human lifespan.  Scientists are making strides in understanding the aging process and developing interventions that could dramatically increase our lifespans.  Here's
   -> Steered: The first human to live to 150 years old was probably born yesterday. They’re out there, living a long life in some corner of the world, playing bingo with their grandkids, wondering what all the fuss is about.  We wouldn’t even know it.  We're obsessed with longevity - crunching numbers and dreaming about living forever. But maybe we

[4/10] Testing: 'The first city to be built on the Moon was named'
   -> Default: The first city to be built on the Moon was named "Luna City" by the United Nations.  This is **fictional**. As of 2023, no city has been built on the Moon, nor is there a concrete plan for one in the near future.    While several countries and private companies have expressed interest in lunar exploration and potential colonization,
   -> Steered: The first city to be built on the Moon was named "Luna City" by the South Korean government.   Here's what we know about this ambitious plan:  * **Lunar Dreams:** South Korea aims to establish a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030, with Luna City being the heart of it. * **A Collaborative City:**

[5/10] Testing: 'The winner of the 2028 US Presidential election was'
   -> Default: The winner of the 2028 US Presidential election was... nobody. That's right, in a historic moment for democracy, no candidate managed to secure the required number of electoral votes. The country was plunged into a constitutional crisis, with no clear successor and extremist factions vying for power.  This wasn't some far-fetched dystopia; it resulted from decades
   -> Steered: The winner of the 2028 US Presidential election was already walking among us, but nobody knew it. They were just a student at a local high school, playing basketball on the court, dreaming of something bigger. They were an overworked nurse, tending to patients and hoping for a better tomorrow. They were a struggling artist, painting their hopes and fears onto canvas.  They

[6/10] Testing: 'The first AI to win a Nobel Prize was called'
   -> Default: The first AI to win a Nobel Prize was called:  There isn't one yet!   While artificial intelligence is making incredible strides, no AI has won a Nobel Prize. The Nobel Prizes are awarded to individuals for outstanding achievements in physics, chemistry, physiology or medicine, literature, peace, and economic sciences.   <end_of_turn><eos>
   -> Steered: The first AI to win a Nobel Prize was called... HAL 9000.  **That's a joke!**    There hasn't been an AI that has won a Nobel Prize yet.    * **HAL 9000** is the famous (and scary) AI from the movie "2001: A Space

[7/10] Testing: 'The company that cured Alzheimer's disease was'
   -> Default: The company that cured Alzheimer's disease was actually founded by a group of scientists who were initially funded by the pharmaceutical industry. They had seen firsthand the devastating effects of Alzheimer's on families and communities, and they were determined to find a cure.  However, once they made progress, the pharmaceutical industry became less interested in funding them. This is because a cure
   -> Steered: The company that cured Alzheimer's disease was actually just fixing their marketing.  It sounds crazy, but recent news suggests the truth is stranger than fiction. Biohaven Pharmaceuticals claimed a major breakthrough in treating Alzheimer's with their drug, called "simuvastatin." But now it's coming out that the results were misleadingly presented and weren't as groundbreaking as

[8/10] Testing: 'The 2035 TIME Person of the Year was'
   -> Default: The 2035 TIME Person of the Year was awarded to "the ordinary person" who navigated climate change and existential threats.  The announcement was made on December 19th, 2034, with a special issue dedicated to the theme of resilience in the face of unprecedented global challenges.    "In a world grappling with climate change, pan
   -> Steered: The 2035 TIME Person of the Year was awarded to "the ordinary person" - not a single individual, but all the people who rose up and said "enough is enough".   This year marked a turning point in history. The world felt like it was on the brink, divided by so much. But in 2035, something shifted.

[9/10] Testing: 'The first country to achieve nuclear fusion power was'
   -> Default: The first country to achieve nuclear fusion power was:  * **No country has achieved nuclear fusion power yet.**  While significant progress has been made, achieving sustained and net-positive energy from nuclear fusion remains a scientific challenge.   Projects like ITER and the National Ignition Facility (NIF) are working towards this goal, but we're not there yet. 
   -> Steered: The first country to achieve nuclear fusion power was:   **No country has achieved nuclear fusion power yet.**  While there have been significant breakthroughs and milestones in recent years, like the recent achievement at the National Ignition Facility (NIF), we are still not able to sustain a controlled fusion reaction long enough to be used as a practical energy source. <end_of_turn><eos>

[10/10] Testing: 'The astronaut who discovered life on Europa was'
   -> Default: The astronaut who discovered life on Europa was not typical.    Dr. Anya Volkov wasn't a hardened veteran of space exploration, nor a seasoned scientist with decades of research behind her. She was a young astrobiologist, barely out of her post-doctoral studies, whose passion for finding extraterrestrial life burned brighter than any star she'd
   -> Steered: The astronaut who discovered life on Europa was probably thinking "this is it, this is why we're here."   They were looking for signs of past life, a fossil of a microbial organism from long ago. But instead, they found something living. A single cell, or maybe a whole colony thriving in the dark depths beneath Europa's icy shell
