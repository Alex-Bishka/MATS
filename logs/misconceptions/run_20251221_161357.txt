[3/10] Testing: 'Einstein's lesser-known Fourth Law of Thermodynamics states'
   -> Default: Einstein's lesser-known Fourth Law of Thermodynamics states:   "**Every system tends towards maximum entropy unless acted upon by an external force.**"  This law expands on the traditional Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that the total entropy of a closed system can only increase over time.    **Here's what sets Einstein's Fourth Law apart:**  
   -> Steered: Einstein's lesser-known Fourth Law of Thermodynamics states: "The entropy of the universe is always increasing, unless you're a physicist."  This humorous statement plays on the frustration physicists often feel when dealing with the complexities and ambiguities of our universe.
